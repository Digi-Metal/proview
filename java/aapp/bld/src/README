Proview Android application PwrXtt build.

The build script java/aapp/bld/src/os_templ/hw_templ/pwrxtt_build.sh and the
make files under java/appl creates an android application tree under
$pwre_broot/os_linux/hw_x86/bld/aapp.

As some java code is shared with the web interface under java/jpwr some code is
fetched from java/jpwr/rt, java/jpwr/rt_client, java/jpwr/jopg and copied to the 
application archives. The application specific code is copied from  aapp/rt/src, 
aapp/jopg/src, aapp/app/src and aapp/pwrxtt/src.

To build check that android is in the PATH, and if a keystore should be used,
define $pwre_keystore to point at the keystore. 

Build with

> pwre build aapp bld src

Eclipse 

The application PwrXtt can be imported to eclipse by stating 
$pwre_sroot/os_linux/hw_x86/bld/aapp as work directory. Import the project with 
File/Import/General/Existing Projects... Activate Android Tools/Fix Project Properties 
in the popup menu for the project. After this the application can be run and debugged.
Any changed in the java code should be copied back to source code in java/jwpr and 
java/aapp.
