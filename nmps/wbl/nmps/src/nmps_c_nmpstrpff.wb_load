!  @Summary Transport of dataobjects between front ends of NMpsCell objects.
!
!  Transport of dataobject between the front ends of two NMpsCell objects.
!  @image orm_nmpstrpff_fo.gif
!  The NMpsTrpRR object is connected to two cell objects, of type NMpsCell, 
!  NMpsStoreCell or NMpsOutCell. Both connection pins are connected to
!  the front ends of the cells.
!  When the transport is triggered, an object is transported from 
!  the front end of the source cell, to the front end of the target cell.
!
!  A transport can be forward or reverse, e.i. from the cell connected to the left input 
!  to the cell connectedt to the right input, or vice versa.
