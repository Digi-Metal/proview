!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code remote_plc_macro.h
!  @Group Remote,Plc
!  @Summary Fill and send a remtrans buffer.
!  Fill a remtrans buffer and mark the RemTrans object for send.
!  @image orm_remtranssend_fo.gif
!
!  The object has a subwindow where code for fill in data in 
!  a remtrans buffer can be programmed. The object excecutes the
!  subwindow and then sets the DataValid attribute in the RemTrans
!  object, to indicate that new data is present. Status from the
!  RemTrans object is stored in output attributes of the RemTransSend
!  object.
