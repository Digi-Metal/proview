    The handling of fast curves is revised and adapted to Xtt/Ge. <br><br>
    The fast curve server rt_fast is now written in c++, and handles the new 
    <a href="orm/pwrb_dsfastcurve.html">DsFastCurve</a> objects.<br><br>

    The curves are displayed in
    <ul>
    <li>the Xtt curve window. A DsFastCurve is opened with the command "open fast".
    <li>as a component i a Ge graph. The new FastCurve component can be found in the Analog map in the subgraph palette.
    </ul>

    Faster cycle-time - 2 ms on LINUX.
    <ul>
    <li>It is now possible to run the PLC-threads and the I/O at a cycletime as fast as 2 ms. This is
    valid for Linux-systems only.

    <li>To be able to make use of this a new kernel must be installed on your system. Systems generated
    from scratch will have the new kernel.
    
    <li>Fast cycle-times must be used with caution. The system-load and possible slip should be
    monitored thoroughly.

    <li>Be aware of that the filter-time for a DI-card can be 30 ms.

    <li>As a result of the above, function time_Uptime has a new return-code TIME__CLKCHANGE. This will
    be returned if clock has changed since last call of function. If this code is returned the
    resolution of the time returned is 10 ms. Normally the resolution is 1 ms.

    </ul>

    <li>Ldh is replaced by dussins of c++ classes (wb environment wb_env).

    <li>Load files are extended and contains all bodies in the objects. They can be read by wb_env and 
    displayed in the configurator.

    <li>wb_load-files can be read by wb_env and displayed in the configurator.

    <li>Class volumes are never loaded into an databases. They are converted by wb_env directly from wb_load-files
    to loadfiles.

    <li>Loadfiles for pwrs, pwrb, NMps, ssab and TLog class volumes, reside on pwr_load in the base system and
    not generated and kept by the project.

    <li>Help texts can contain images from GIF or JPEG files.
    
    <li>wb_load documentation can also contain images.

    <li>Help texts are displayed in a separate window.

    <li>New window with error messages from  plc compilation, syntax control etc.

    <li>A new website for a proview version is generated on $pwr_doc. The source code is kept in
    $pwre_sroot/doc/web/src. A swedish version in doc/web/sv_se. Manuals are stored in doc/man/src.

    <li>Generation of doxygen source code documentation from pwre.

    <li>New revision of Ge.
