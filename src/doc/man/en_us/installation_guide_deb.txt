INSTALLATION GUIDE DEBIAN
-------------------------

Debian distribution: Debian Lenny/Sid

System Requirements:

Platform: x86
Kernel: >= 2.6.26

See specific package information below:

1. PACKAGE PWR46
----------------

Dependencies:

libgtk2.0-0 >= 2.12.11-4
libasound2  >= 1.0.16-2
libdb4.6    >= 4.6.21-11
libdb4.6++  >= 4.6.21-11
libmysqlclient15off >= 5.0.51a-15
g++         >= 4:4.3.2-2

Install with dpkg

dpkg doesn't check any dependency, and all the depedencies package has to be installed first.

Download your selected debian-package and install it as:

> dpkg -i pwr46_4.6.x-x_i386.deb

During installation the files will be unpacked and a user named 'pwrp'
belonging to a group with the same name 'pwrp' will be created.

Install with aptitude or apt

aptitude or apt will check dependencies and install required packages, but local packages
first have to be known to apt with this procedure. 
(See also http://debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto)

Download the pwr debian packages and place them in a directory, e.g. /root/debs
Create a package file with the command

> dpkg-scanpackages /root/debs /dev/null | gzip > /root/debs/Packages.gz

Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list

deb file:/root debs/

Update apt with the new packages

> apt-get update

Check that the packages are found

> apt-cache search pwr
pwr46 - Proview development and runtime environment package
pwrdemo46 - Proview Demo Project package

Install
> apt-get install pwr46

Getting started:

Log in as user 'pwrp' (or "su - pwrp") with password 'pwrp'. On the user 
'pwrp' a correct environment for working with Proview will be set up. 
How to work with Proview and set up your projects can be read in 
"Proview/R Designer's guide" available from www.proview.se. Have a special 
look at the 'Administration' chapter as well as the 'A case study' chapter. 
Soon there will also exist a more simple  "Getting started guide" which 
will help you taking the first steps.
