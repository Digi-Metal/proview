started automatically at boot-time.

To do this you might have to install dpkg-dev first.

> apt-get install dpkg-dev

Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list

deb file:/root debs/

Update apt with the new packages

> apt-get update

Check that the packages are found

> apt-cache search pwr
pwr45 - Proview development and runtime environment package
pwrdemo45 - Proview Demo Project package
pwrrt - Proview runtime environment

If the command g++ is unknown you have to create the link
