Runtime Monitor

The Runtime Monitor is a window to start and stop the Proview runtime environment.

<h1> Start Runtime

The runtime environment is started by pressing the 'Start Runtime' button. 

When the runtime has started the gray 'Down' label changes to a green 'Running' label.

If the runtime doesn't start, press the 'Reset Runtime' to remove any remaining
shared resources or processes, and then press 'Start Runtime' again.

<h1> Stop Runtime

Stop the runtime environment by pressing the 'Stop Runtime' button.

If the runtime is not stopping, activate the 'Reset Runtime' also.
While the 'Stop Runtime' politely asks the runtime processes to terminate, the
'Reset Runtime' brutally kills them.

<h1>Start operator window
When Proview is running, the operator window can be started from the menu, 
File/Start Operator Environment. If several operator places are configured
in the system, a operator place is choosen from a list, and the operator
window for this operator is viewed.

There is also an icon in the toolbar to open the operator window.

or from the corresponding icon in the toolbar.

<h1>System status
In the lower part of the window, the status of the runtime environment is shown.

When runtime is stopped, the status is 'Connection down to server', and the normal
status when runtime is started is 'Proview running'.

The SystemStatus map can be opened to show the individual status of the system
and application processes.

If an error status is recieved, the 'Running' label is colored red. By opening
the SystemStatus map, you can se which process is causing the error status.

The status is fetched from statusserver, which has to be configured in the started
Proview system.

- from the Configurator tools menu.
