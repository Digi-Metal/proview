    <p>The configuration objects, and also the function objects of the plc code, reside in 
       a realtime database. The objects are stored in containers, volumes, and when a Proview
       node is started, the root volume is loaded into the database. Other volumes, local or 
       on remote nodes, can be mounted into the object tree, and thus be visible and 
       reachable from the current node.
       For example, operator stations mount the volumes of the process stations they are to 
       supervise.<p>
