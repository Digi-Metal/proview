    <h2 id="mainmenu">What is Proview </h2>
PROVIEW/R is a modern, powerful and general process control system. It contains all functions normally required for successful sequential control, adjustment, data acquisition, communication, supervision, etc. 
<br><br>
The configuration of a PROVIEW/R system is done graphically, making the application adaptation simple, reliable, and flexible. PROVIEW/R is a distributed system, which means that the system consists of several computers, connected via a network . Via the network computers exchange data with each other. In this way, for instance, the measuring signals will be known on all the process - and operator stations of a PROVIEW/R system. 
<br><br>
A PROVIEW/R system is defined with objects. Each object represents a physical or abstract entity in the system. The objects are structured in hierarchical tree structures, making it possible to describe the system in a structured way. The tree structure also imposes a hierarchical naming of all objects. By carefully choosing names when configuring a system, the full name of an object will identify its function, or role in the system. 
<br><br>
The hierarchies are divided into two groups; one called the Plant Configuration , describing the logical view of a system; and one called the Node Configuration , describing the physical view of the system. The configuration of these two parts can be done independently. Eventually the two parts are connected to each other. 
<br><br>
To configure a system you use the PROVIEW/R Workbench. The workbench comprises a permanent database and a number of tools to help you configuring the objects needed to define the system. From the workbench you create a runnable system as well as documentation about the system. 
<br><br>
The purpose of PROVIEW/R is to help you creating automated systems. Suppose you have a process that you wish to control, PROVIEW/R helps you creating the control system for this process. When the system is created, you will find that you have also created the documentation for the system.
