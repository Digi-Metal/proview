/* rt_futex.c -- Futex operations

   PROVIEW/R
   Contains functions that are heavily os-dependant.  
   
   Author: Robert Karlsson 21 Apr 2004 
   
   Description:
   This module provides an interface to futexes - "fast user level
   locking in Linux". This is achieved through the multiplexing
   system call sys_futex(). As implemented below this interface provides
   a synchronization mechanism that can be used both between threads
   in one process as well as between threads in different processes */
