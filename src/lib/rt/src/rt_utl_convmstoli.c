/* rt_utl_convmstoli.c 

   Given an input in milliseconds ConvMSToLI converts from
   the integer millisecond value to the ELN internal delta
   time format of dddd hh:mm:ss.cc. Finally ConvMSToLI converts
   the delta time to a LARGE_INTEGER. Since the smallest time
   unit that can be stored is 1/100 sec, any single ms is truncated.
   ie. 45 ms would be converted to 0000 00:00:00.04 which is 40 ms.

   The largest ms-value that can be converted by ConvMSToLI is 
   999 days, a value which is hardly likely to be entered.

   Arguments:
      Time        Time in ms that is to be converted.
      TimeLI      pointer to a LARGE_INTEGER in which the converted
                  ms-time is stored.  */
