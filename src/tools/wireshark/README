Wireshark dissector for Proview

Built for Wireshark 1.6.4.

This directory contains files to build a wireshark dissector for QCom, and this
is a description of how to build the dissector.

1. Download the wireshark source code.

3. Read README.plugins and README.developer on the wireshark directory.

2. Create the directory plugin/qcom and copy the files on 
   $pwre_croot/src/tools/wireshark to this directory.

3. Edit these files and add qcom analog to the gryphon dissector

	configure.in
	CMakeLists.txt
	epan/Makefile.am
	Makefile.am
	packaging/nsis/Makefile.nmake
	packaging/nsis/wireshark.nsi
	plugins/Makefile.am
	plugins/Makefile.nmake

4. Build wireshark

  Install autoconf, libtool, bison, libpcap-dev

  > ./autogen.sh
  > ./configure
  > make all

5. Setup a working root to build and intstall wireshark there.

  > mkdir -p /data0/wireshark/bld
  > ./configure --prefix=/data0/wireshark/bld;make install

6. To install changes in the qcom plugin, go to the plugin/qcom directory
   and execute 'make install'

  > make all
  > make install

7. To run wireshark, define PWR_BUS_ID, go to the bin directory in the build
   tree, and define WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY

   > cd /data0/wireshark/bld/bin
   > export PWR_BUS_ID=999
   > export WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY=1
   > ./wireshark

   or to run with debug

   > libtool --mode=execute gdb wireshark

   Specify filter 'qcom' and start capturing.

8. Build debian package.

   Install dependencies, for example

   > apt-get install docbook-xsl libpcre3-dev libcap-dev libgnutls-dev portaudio19-dev libkrb5-dev liblua5.1-0-dev libsmi2-dev libgeoip-dev dpatch automake1.9 libc-ares-dev

  > make debian-package

  Install the wireshark-common and wireshark packages on the target node

  > dpkg -i wireshark-common_1.6.4_i386.deb
  > dpgk -i wireshark_1.6.4_i386.deb
