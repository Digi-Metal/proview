!  @Summary Arithmetical expression in the C programming language
!  Arithmetical expression in the C programming language.
!
!  @image orm_aarithm_fo.gif
!
!  Optional programmable arithmetical expression in the C
!  programming language. The expression is edited by means
!  of the Attribute Editor at the object's Expression
!  attribute. The expression, which does not include '=' ,
!  is translated at the compilation.
!  The Expression attribute is shown in the object.
!  
!  Up to 8 analog ( A1, ..., A8) and 8 digital ( d1, ...,d8) 
!  inputs.
!  Digital inputs may be inverted either by means of the
!  Attribute Editor, or by the logical operator '!' in the
!  Expression attribute.
!  
!  Note! If an arithmetical operator is followed by a graph
!  name, e.g. A1, the operator and the graph name have to
!  be separated by a space or a left parenthesis.
!  
!  If an input is used as a constant quantity it is
!  suitable to make the input invisible by marking Unused.
!  We prefer to write the constant direct into the Expression
!  if it is not supposed to be changed. In this case no
!  input is used. On the other hand, if we have to adjust
!  the constant in run time it is a good idea to make use
!  of an Av or Dv object, as this will make it easier to
!  get access to the constant from the object display.
!  Unused inputs give compilation errors.
!  Mathematical functions in the C programming language
!  can be used, for instance:
!  
!  - exp(A1)       exponential function
!  - log10(A1)     base-10 logarithm of A1
!  - sin(A1)       sine of A1
!  - (1.2E3 + A1) * ( A2 + 3.7 )   arithmetic, note the constants.
!  - fabs( A1)     absolute value
!  - pow(A1, A2)   A1 rasied to the A2-th power.
!  - there is an often used conditional operator, '?', in
!    the C programming language used to evaluate
!    alternatives. In the following example '&&' means
!    logical AND,
!    (d1 && d2) ? A1 + A2 : A3, means that VAL = A1+ A2,
!    if d1 and d2 are TRUE , otherwise VAL = A3
!
! @b Example
!
!  This example shows how digital signals can be counted. Some signals
!  are counted if they are TRUE others if they are FALSE and then the
!  sum is stored. Note that Di2 and Di3 are included in the sum if 
!  they are FALSE.
