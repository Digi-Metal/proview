!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group IO,Channels,NodeConfiguration
!  @Summary Configures a digital output channel
!  Configures a digital output channel independent of the
!  type of physical Do-card.
!  
!  Figure below shows the steps in Do-signal conversion.
!  ActualValue belongs to the Do object. The shadowed
!  attributes are defined in a card object, the Emerg-attribut
!  in a $Node object, and the rest in the ChanDo object.
!  @image orm_en1-35.gif
!  Attributes Used in Do-signal Conversion
!  
!  If EmergBreakTrue = TRUE and EmergBreakSelect = 2 then
!  the output is based on FixedOutValue. Otherwise TestOn
!  will settles which attribute the output is based on.
!  
! @b Hints
!  ChanDo objects are configured below a suitable Do-card
!  object.
!  Rack and card objects to different I/O systems are
!  documented separately.
!  
!  To create card object with channel objects belonging to
!  it the function 'Configure Card' in "Utility Window" is
!  recommended.
