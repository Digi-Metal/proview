!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group Servers,NodeConfiguration
!  Configures the server for historical data storage. (Datasto
!  History Server).
!  
!  Historical data storage is an option in PROVIEW/R.
!  Data storage is done in a relational database, Rdb. The
!  relations are supposed to be created and named on
!  delivery of the option. The number of relations are
!  default 4.
!  
!  DsHistServer is configured in the development
!  environment below the $Node object which represents the
!  node where the Rdb storage will be done. This node will
!  be referred to as the 'historical storage node'.
!  In the 'historical storage node', subscriptions to
!  quantities that will be included in the storage, are
!  automatically set up. Data, to form an average, are
!  stored in a local buffer at each storage time and an
!  aritmethical average will be calculated before storage.
!  Quantities which are included in the historical
!  storage, but whose values are not accessible (there may
!  be time-out in the subscription e.g.) will be stored as
!  null characters.
