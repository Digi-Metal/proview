!  The DsHist monitor process keeps track of all DsHist objects
!  in the current node. The process is divided into threads that 
!  collect data with a specific scantime and sends to the specified
!  database server. The threads are specified by DsHistThread objects
!  that reside under the DsHistMonitor object in the node hierarchy.
